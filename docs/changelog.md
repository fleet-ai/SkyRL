# SkyRL Fleet Training - Changelog

### v0.2.5 (2026-01-29) - Run `fleet_tool_use_a7e85045`

**Changes:**
- Removed checkpoint/resume logic from Tinker (not needed currently)
- Unified metric aggregation between SkyRL trainer and Tinker

**Results (Step 80):**

| Environment | Step 0 | Step 80 | Delta | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| booking | 53.8% | 57.7% | +3.8% | ➖ FLAT |
| fira | 40.0% | 40.0% | +0.0% | ➖ FLAT |
| github | 46.7% | **70.0%** | **+23.3%** | 📈 IMPROVED |
| hubspot | 100.0% | 100.0% | +0.0% | ✅ SATURATED |
| outlook | 100.0% | 100.0% | +0.0% | ✅ SATURATED |
| reddit | 66.7% | 66.7% | +0.0% | ➖ FLAT |
| ticketmaster | 3.6% | 7.1% | +3.6% | ❌ FAILING |
| zillow | 50.0% | 50.0% | +0.0% | ➖ FLAT |
| **OVERALL** | 43.1% | **50.9%** | **+7.8%** | |

**Trajectories:** `s3://skyrl-trajectories/evals/fleet_tool_use_a7e85045/`

**Issues Found:**
- **ticketmaster**: Only 1 unique eval task (dataset bug) - complex 5+ step e-commerce workflow
- **hubspot/outlook**: Saturated at 100% from step 0 - no learning signal
- **github**: Best improvement (+23.3%), training working well

---

### v0.2.4 (2026-01-29) - Data Split Changes

**Changes:** Code change to `prepare_dataset.py` - no new underlying data, same v0.2 source.

| Parameter | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| eval_ratio | 2% | 10% |
| MAX_EVAL_SAMPLES | - | 30 per env |
| outlook | held-out | split normally |

**Result**: ticketmaster now gets ~22 eval samples for trace analysis (was 0).

---

### v0.2.2 (2025-01-27) - Run `mk6nr5ij`

**Changes:** Initial training run with v0.2 dataset fixes.

**Results:**

| Issue | Baseline | Current | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Issue 0**: GitHub no env response | 88% no response, 1.1 tool calls | 14.3 avg tool calls | ✅ FIXED |
| **Issue 1**: Excessive thinking | 81% token budget on thinking | 6K tokens (success) vs 11K (failure) | ⚠️ IMPROVED |
| **Issue 2**: Cannot signal done | 40% booking stuck | max_turns=6 (booking), tasks completing | ✅ FIXED |
| **Issue 3**: Tool repetition | 56% booking, 20x repeats | - | ❓ NEEDS ANALYSIS |
| **Issue 4**: Hitting max turns | 90% hit 50 turns | booking max=6, reddit max=5 | ✅ IMPROVED |

| Environment | Baseline | Current pass@3 | Delta |
|-------------|----------|----------------|-------|
| GitHub | 0% | 42.1% | **+42.1%** |
| Booking | ~5% | 52.6% | **+47.6%** |
| Outlook | ~5% | 36.8% | **+31.8%** |
| Overall | 2.9% | 43.4% | **+40.5%** |

**Observations:**
- GitHub environment now responding (14.3 avg tool calls vs 1.1)
- Tasks completing before max turns (booking max=6, not 50)
- Successful trajectories use fewer tokens (6K vs 11K for failures)

### v0.2.1 (2025-01-27)

**Infrastructure fix: rope_scaling for vLLM 0.13.0 and HuggingFace**

| Fix | Issue | Change |
|-----|-------|--------|
| vLLM rope_scaling | vLLM 0.13.0 removed direct `rope_scaling` param | Pass via `hf_overrides["rope_parameters"]` per [vLLM docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/examples/offline_inference/context_extension/) |
| HuggingFace rope_scaling | HF models reject `rope_scaling` as kwarg | Set `model_config.rope_scaling` instead of passing to `from_pretrained()` |

**PR:** [NovaSky-AI/SkyRL#976](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL/pull/976)

---

### v0.2 (2026-01-26)

**Dataset:** `s3://fleet-internal-datasets/v0.2/openenv/all_tool_use.json`

| Fix | Issue Addressed | Change |
|-----|-----------------|--------|
| Context extension | Issue 1 (Context Budget) | YaRN rope_scaling (65K context), MAX_INPUT_LENGTH 24K→48K, MAX_GENERATE_LENGTH 4K→8K |
| Done signal prompt | Issue 2 (Task Completion) | System prompt requires `<tool_call>` OR `<done>` every turn |
| Error handling prompt | Issue 3 (Tool Repetition) | System prompt: "Do NOT repeat the same call with identical arguments" |
| env_variables fix | Date/user errors | Training data now includes `CURRENT_DATE`, `LOGGED_IN_USER`, `LOGGED_IN_NAME` (95% coverage) |

**Commits:**
- `de6b4b4` - Enable YaRN for 65K context, increase generation length
- `6a9b813` - Strengthen system prompt for task completion signaling
- `<pending>` - Add error handling to system prompt

## Issue 0: Environment Not Returning Tool Results (GitHub)

**Severity: CRITICAL - INFRASTRUCTURE BUG**

88% of GitHub trajectories make a tool call but NEVER receive an environment response. The trajectory ends at `</tool_call><|im_end|>` with no tool result.

| Environment | No Env Response |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **GitHub**  | **88% (100/114)** |
| Booking     | 19% (11/57)     |
| Outlook     | 19% (14/72)     |

**Impact:** GitHub has 0% success rate because tool calls go unanswered.

**Root Cause:** Unknown - could be:
- Bug in GitHub Fleet environment
- Timeout issues
- Malformed tool calls crashing the env

**Recommendation:** Debug Fleet GitHub environment, check logs for errors.

---

## Issue 1: Excessive Thinking (81% of token budget on GitHub)

**Severity: CRITICAL**

The model spends excessive tokens on `<think>` blocks, leaving insufficient budget for actual tool calls and actions.

| Environment | Avg Response | Thinking % | Tool Calls Avg |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| GitHub      | 7,616 chars  | **81.3%**  | 1.1            |
| Outlook     | 21,262 chars | 58.4%      | 8.1            |
| Booking     | 26,493 chars | 47.6%      | 14.3           |

**Impact:** GitHub has 0% success rate because model only completes ~1 tool call before hitting generation limit.

**Recommendation:**
- Reduce thinking verbosity via system prompt
- Consider removing `<think>` blocks for tool-use tasks
- Increase `max_generate_length` significantly

---

## Issue 2: Cannot Signal Task Completion

**Severity: CRITICAL**

When the model completes a task and tries to give a final response (without a tool call), the environment rejects it:
```
"No tool call found. Use <tool_call>{...}</tool_call> format."
```

**Stats:**
- Booking: 40% of trajectories have this error
- Outlook: 36% of trajectories have this error

**Example (Booking):**
Model says: "The hotel offers a price per night of $132, which is within your budget. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
→ Environment rejects: "No tool call found"

**Impact:** Model cannot communicate task completion, forcing infinite tool call loops.

**Recommendation:**
- Add a `task_complete` tool for signaling completion
- Or accept `<done>` tag without requiring tool call
- Or modify system prompt to explain how to signal completion

---

## Issue 3: Tool Call Repetition (up to 20x same call)

**Severity: HIGH**

Model makes identical tool calls repeatedly, wasting turns.

| Environment | Trajectories with Repetition | Max Repetitions |
|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Booking     | 56%                          | 20x             |
| Outlook     | 54%                          | 9x              |
| GitHub      | 17%                          | 3x              |

**Example (Booking):**
Same `hotels_search` call made 20 times with identical parameters.

**Root Cause:** Model doesn't track which calls it already made, or doesn't properly process results.

**Recommendation:**
- Add tool call history to context
- Penalize repeated identical calls in reward
- Improve system prompt to track progress

---

## Issue 4: Hitting Max Turns (90% of trajectories)

**Severity: HIGH**

Most trajectories end by hitting max turns (50), not by completing the task.

| Environment | Hit Max Turns | Stopped Clean |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| GitHub      | 100%          | 0%            |
| Booking     | 84%           | 16%           |
| Outlook     | 81%           | 19%           |

**Root Cause:** Combination of Issues 1-3 (excessive thinking, can't signal done, repetition).

---

## Issue 5: Thinking Pattern Repetition

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Model repeats the same reasoning/thoughts within trajectories.

**Example (Booking):**
"If today is October 2023, then February 9th, 2024 is in the future..." repeated 14 times.

**Impact:** Wastes token budget on redundant reasoning.

---

## Issue 6: Hallucinated Parameters

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Model invents parameter values when they're not available.

**Example (GitHub):**
```json
{"name": "createPullRequest", "arguments": {"repo_id": "123", "user_id": "456"}}
```
These are made-up IDs that don't exist.

**Recommendation:**
- System prompt should emphasize fetching required data first
- Provide examples of proper tool chaining

---

## Issue 7: Done Signal Without Task Completion

**Severity: LOW**

18% of Outlook trajectories emit `<done>` but have 0 score.

**Root Cause:** Model says done prematurely without actually completing task.

---

## Priority Fixes

1. **[CRITICAL] Fix completion signaling** - Add `task_complete` tool or accept non-tool-call responses
2. **[CRITICAL] Reduce thinking overhead** - Shorter prompts, no think blocks, or increased budget
3. **[HIGH] Add tool call tracking** - Prevent identical repeated calls
4. **[HIGH] Increase max_generate_length** - Current limit too restrictive for multi-step tasks
5. **[MEDIUM] Improve tool chaining guidance** - System prompt examples for proper API sequences
